The contract defines a simple betting game called "Whale of Fortune". In this game, players place bets on a number between 0 and 6, and a random number is generated using a trusted third-party oracle service called an "entropy beacon". If the player's chosen number matches one of the digits in the randomly generated number, they win the game and receive a payout.
